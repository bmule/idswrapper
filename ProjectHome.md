**IDSWrapper** is a first step toward a universal and easily **extendible** API for host/network-based _Intrusion Detection Systems_ (IDS)s.

It can virtually **encapsulate** any type of IDS with a little effort of writing Java implementation classes.

It provides an abstract (also graphical) interface that represents the IDS and eases the tedious task of **accuracy evaluation** in an automated fashion.

The project is managed by VPLAB at Politecnico di Milano.
